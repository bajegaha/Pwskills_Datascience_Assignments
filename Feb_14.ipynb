    "Ans------> Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently, allowing it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. It's used to improve the responsiveness of applications by executing time-consuming tasks in the background without blocking the main program's execution. The threading module in Python is used to handle threads.</br>\n",
